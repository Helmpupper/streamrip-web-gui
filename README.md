# Streamrip Web GUI

A web interface for [Streamrip](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip), providing a GUI for downloading music from various streaming services. 

Streamrip is lit but CLI-only. Having to SSH into my stupid little server each time I wanted to download a track was too much effort for me. 
(Mainly Quboz for me low key I don't even know if Tidal/Deezer work because I don't have accounts for them)

Intended to be used for Docker/Docker-Compose but you can run it locally too.

- **Configuration Editor**: Edit streamrip settings directly from the web interface
- **Docker Ready**: Easy deployment with Docker

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (if running without Docker)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Valid streaming service credentials configured in streamrip

## Installation

You MUST install and configure Streamrip first.

1. Install Streamrip:
```bash
pip install streamrip
```

2. Configure Streamrip:

Follow the [Streamrip configuration guide](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip/wiki/Configuration) to set up your credentials.

### Option 1: Pre-built workflow. 
1: Add this to your `docker-compose.yml`

```
  streamrip:
    image: anoddname/streamrip-web-gui:latest 
    container_name: streamrip-web
    user: "1000:1000"
    environment:
      - HOME=/config
      - XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/config
      - STREAMRIP_CONFIG=/config/streamrip/config.toml
      - DOWNLOAD_DIR=/music
      - MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=1
    volumes:
      - /home/YOURUSERNAME/.config/streamrip:/config/streamrip:rw
      - /home/YOURUSERNAME/media-server/data/Music:/music:rw
    ports:
      - "5002:5000"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2: run with `docker-compose up`

3: Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5002`

### Option 2: Docker

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anoddname/streamrip-web-gui.git
cd streamrip-web
```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
services:    
  streamrip:
        build: ./streamrip-web
        container_name: streamrip
        user: "1000:1000" 
        environment:
          - HOME=/config
          - XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/config
          - STREAMRIP_CONFIG=/config/streamrip/config.toml
          - DOWNLOAD_DIR=/music
          - MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=2
        volumes:
          - /home/YOURUSERNAME/.config/streamrip:/config/streamrip:rw
          - /home/YOURUSERNAME/media-server/data/Music:/music:rw
        ports:
          - "5002:5000"
        restart: unless-stopped
```

3. Build and run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5002`

### Option 3: Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anoddname/streamrip-web.git
cd streamrip-web
```

2. Install dependencies:

pip install flask gunicorn requests
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py

## Configuration

### Streamrip Configuration

Before using Streamrip Web, you need to configure streamrip with your streaming service credentials:

1. **Qobuz**: Requires email and password (or TOKEN)
2. **Tidal**: Requires email and password  
3. **Deezer**: Requires ARL
4. **SoundCloud**: Works without authentication

Check the [Streamrip documentation](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip/wiki) for instructions.

## Usage

### Downloading from URL

1. Paste a streaming service URL in the input field
2. Select quality (MP3 128/320 or FLAC 16/24-bit)
3. Click DOWNLOAD

### Searching for Music

1. Select a streaming service from the dropdown
2. Choose search type (Albums, Tracks, or Artists)
3. Enter your search query
4. Click on DOWNLOAD next to any result

- Searches will use the QUALITY from the URL paste dropdown.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Config file not found"**: Make sure streamrip is properly configured. Run `rip config` to create a configuration file. Also check locations.

2. **Downloads failing/Searches timing out**: Check that your streaming service credentials are valid and properly configured in streamrip. Tidal will timeout, Deezer will throw errors.

3. **Downloads disappearing from Active DL/History tabs**:  The files were still prolly downloaded, dont worry about it I'll fix it later it was pissing me off

4. **No images when run locally**: CORS issue

5. Unable to open database file/Failed to parse JSON Error: This occurs when the config file inside the container has wrong paths. Fix it with:
```bash
docker exec -it streamrip /bin/bash
sed -i 's|/home/YOURUSERNAME/StreamripDownloads|/music|g' /config/streamrip/config.toml
sed -i 's|/home/YOURUSERNAME/.config/streamrip/|/config/streamrip/|g' /config/streamrip/config.toml
exit
```
  Note to replace `YOURUSERNAME` with, you guessed it, your username.
